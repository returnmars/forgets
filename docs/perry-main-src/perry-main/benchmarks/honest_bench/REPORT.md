# Perry vs Rust vs Zig — honest benchmark results

Numbers are measured against Perry v0.5.81 on five implementations: Rust, Zig, Perry, Node.js, Bun. All three workloads complete on all five implementations — every correctness and scaling bug the bench originally surfaced (`#38`–`#53`, `#62`–`#65`) has landed in Perry mainline. 260 measured runs, zero failures.

## Bottom line

- **Compute (image convolution, tight loop, minimal heap):** Zig 243 ms.
  **Perry 268 ms (1.10× Zig) — ahead of Rust's 567 ms**, 3.4× faster than
  Bun, 4.5× faster than Node. Full arc across the perf sprint:
  **2261 ms → 268 ms, an 8.4× speedup** (issues #47, #48, #49, #50, #52 plus
  the v0.5.58–v0.5.68 follow-on).
- **Allocation-heavy (JSON pipeline, 100 records):** Zig 32 ms, Rust 33 ms,
  **Perry 37 ms (1.15× the fastest) — ahead of Bun's 49 ms and Node's 145 ms**,
  at 3 MB RSS vs Bun's 11 MB and Node's 36 MB. Earlier sweep had Perry at
  210 ms here; v0.5.69–v0.5.75 closed ~6× of that.
- **JSON at scale (500k records, 108 MB):** Rust 604 ms, Bun 647 ms, Zig
  850 ms, Node 1010 ms, **Perry 1649 ms**. Perry trails the pack by ~2.5×
  on wall time and uses more RSS (744 MB peak), but it _completes_ — as
  recently as v0.5.68 this workload hung >13 min CPU without finishing
  (`#65`, now closed).
- **Binary size:** Zig smallest (~230 KB), Rust next (~300–380 KB), Perry
  (~550–700 KB, including GC + Node-compat shims). Node/Bun don't have
  standalone binaries — they require their runtime installed separately.
- **Source LoC (non-blank, non-comment):** The TypeScript implementations
  (Perry / Node / Bun run the same source) are in the 52–92-line range;
  Rust and Zig at 99–113. TypeScript gives ~25–40% fewer lines at
  competitive-to-native performance on two of three workloads.

## Honest findings — Perry gaps surfaced by this benchmark

Building the Perry implementations surfaced 8 real bugs. **7 of them were fixed in v0.5.30** while this benchmark was being written; the 8th was only visible once the earlier fixes landed. Each has a standalone 20-line TS repro.

### Fixed in v0.5.30

1. **`buf[i] = v` on `Buffer` / `Uint8Array` was a silent no-op.** The
   lowering for `Expr::Uint8ArraySet` in `crates/perry-codegen/src/expr.rs`
   was `lower_expr(value)` — it evaluated the RHS and threw it away. The
   runtime helper `js_buffer_set(buf, idx, val)` already existed; the
   codegen just wasn't calling it. _Fixed in this commit._

2. **[#38]** `new Uint8Array(N)` with a non-literal `N` routed to
   `js_uint8array_from_array` and misread the number as an `ArrayHeader*`,
   yielding a zero-length buffer. _Fixed._

3. **[#39]** 64-bit BigInt bitwise ops (XOR, AND-mask, multiply-and-mask)
   produced wrong results — `a ^ 5n` returned a small negative, AND-masking
   with `0xFFFF…n` collapsed to 0. Any FNV-1a-64 / Murmur / xxhash64
   implementation collapsed to 0 under Perry. _Fixed._

4. **[#40]** `Math.imul` was not lowered by the codegen (compile-time
   `expression MathImul not yet supported`). Every 32-bit-wrap hash in the
   world uses it. _Fixed._

5. **[#41]** `process.argv.slice(N)` returned a shape with `typeof` =
   `"string"`, length = the full argv length, and elements that were raw
   NaN-box bit patterns interpreted as tiny denormal floats. _Fixed._

6. **[#42]** Passing a multi-MB `Buffer` as a function parameter while the
   callee ran its own `Buffer.alloc()` silently corrupted the parameter.
   The param landed in a callee-saved register the conservative stack scan
   didn't cover; the intervening GC swept the backing buffer. _Fixed._

7. **[#43]** `JSON.stringify` panicked inside `perry-runtime/src/json.rs:427`
   (`byte index N is not a char boundary`) on arrays of 30k+ records with
   nested objects — reading already-corrupted string payloads, likely from
   the same underlying GC issue as #42. _Fixed._

8. **[#44]** `JSON.parse` + iterate + field read on a 50k-record array with
   rich objects dropped 99.9% of `.active === true` matches — the parsed
   objects were being swept mid-iteration. _Fixed._

### Still open

9. **[#46]** `JSON.parse` silently caps output at ~1666 entries for inputs
   larger than roughly 4 MB of structured records. Returns without error;
   `parsed.length` is just 1666 instead of the real count. Surfaced only
   after the #43 panic was fixed — previously the panic fired before the
   truncation was visible. This is why the Perry JSON pipeline is still
   run on the 100-record fixture only.

### Net effect on the numbers

The Perry columns in this report reflect a Perry-TS written *with the
workarounds for #38–#44 still in place* (hand-rolled `imul32`, module-level
`Buffer` globals, fresh-object construction in JSON) — removing those
workarounds after v0.5.30 would simplify the code further but wouldn't
materially change the numbers; the slow paths are the hash loop, the JSON
parse, and the convolution kernel, none of which are affected by the
workaround shape.

## Methodology

- **Release / optimized builds only**: `cargo --release`, `zig build-exe -O
  ReleaseFast`, Perry's native path (auto-optimized libraries).
- **Warmup / measured**: configurable via `HONEST_BENCH_WARMUP` and
  `HONEST_BENCH_MEASURED` (defaults: 5 / 20). **Median** is reported
  because it's robust to the occasional stray OS scheduler hiccup; σ is
  reported alongside.
- **Wall time**: Python `time.monotonic_ns()` delta around the binary
  invocation (so it includes process startup + fs open + the work itself).
- **Peak RSS**: `/usr/bin/time -l`'s `peak memory footprint`, captured in
  bytes and converted to kB / MB.
- **Correctness**: every run emits a line containing a record-count and an
  FNV-1a-32 hash. The driver records stdout's first + last 200 characters
  for each run, which is the minimum needed to verify the three languages
  agree on what they computed.
- **Source LoC**: non-blank, non-comment lines. Computed by the report
  script (no `tokei` / `scc` needed).
- **Fixtures**: deterministic — `scripts/gen_json.py` writes byte-identical
  output across runs. The image convolution uses an in-process xorshift32
  stream.

No SIMD intrinsics, no hand-vectorized loops, no `#[target_feature]` — the
code in each language is what a typical first pass would look like. The
compilers' autovectorizers do their own thing.

## Reproduction

```bash
cd benchmarks/honest_bench
./run.sh                           # build, generate fixtures, run, write results/
python3 scripts/plot.py            # render charts/*.png
python3 scripts/report.py          # regenerate REPORT.md
```

Environment overrides:

```bash
HONEST_BENCH_WARMUP=1 HONEST_BENCH_MEASURED=3 ./run.sh    # quick iteration
HONEST_BENCH_ONLY=3 ./run.sh                              # image conv only
HONEST_BENCH_SKIP_BUILD=1 ./run.sh                        # reuse existing bins
```

The workload-2 HTTP server benchmark is deferred to a follow-up — it requires
an HTTP load generator (oha/wrk/hey) and a Perry `fastify` implementation
under sustained concurrent load. Not landed in this phase.
